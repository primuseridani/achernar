<?php addHeading("The Embedded Assembler", "about"); ?>

<section>
	<p>The <em>Embedded Assembler</em> (or simply <em>eAS</em>; as in <i>ease</i>) is an assembler for cross-compiling to Arm ISAs.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The assembler is intended as a drop-in replacement for the official <em>armasm</em> assembler by Arm Limited. It therefore imitates the same syntax.</p>

	<p>Like <a href="?p=luma"><em>Luma</em></a>, the development of <em>eAS</em> is currently on hold in favour of the <a href="?p=pollex"><em>Pollex</em></a> library, which will be used as a backend.</p>
