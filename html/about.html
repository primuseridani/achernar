				<p class="heading">INCEPTION</p>

				<p><b>Achernar</b> was founded in the summer of 2024 by I, <em>Gabriel Bj√∏rnager Jensen</em>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Our domain &ndash; <span class="code">achernar.dk</span> &ndash; was already registered in the winter of 2021, at that time being used for hosting on-line source code repositories. This was, however, quickly outsourced to <span class="code"><a href="https://mandelbrot.dk">mandelbrot.dk</a></span> after I had managed to secure that domain.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="code">achernar.dk</span> was then, in the mean time, used for hosting a few look-up references. This mostly served as my own notes for school &ndash; mainly mathematics, physics, and chemistry &ndash; but quickly grew unorganised and umaintained, although I did have plans to expand the lexicon.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The idea of a company had started in the spring of 2020 &ndash; at that time having been named after the binary system <em>Sheliak</em> (Bayer: <span class="code">&beta; Lyr&#230;</span>).</p>
