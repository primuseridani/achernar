				<p><em>Achernar</em> is a small, indie development studio based in the Capital Region of Denmark. &#127465;&#127472;</p>
				<br>
				<p>We develop open-source software, including video games and more productive software. We work with embedded systems as well as hosted ones.</p>

				<p>The goal of <em>Achernar</em> is to promote modern and robustly written open-source projects and alike.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In other words, our vision is to develop a human and clean industry and community for technology.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Currently, our roadmap is as follows:</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Complete the webservice before <em>autumn, 2024</em></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Release our first game by <em>2024</em></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Release early-access for Bowshock on Steam by <em>2025</em></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Restructure to a normal sole proprietorship</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>As <em>Achernar</em> is currently registered as a <em>PMV</em> (lesser sole proprietorship), <em>Gabriel Bjørnager Jensen</em> is currently our only member.</p>

				<p><em>Achernar</em> was founded in the summer of 2024 by I, <em>Gabriel Bjørnager Jensen</em>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Our domain &ndash; <code>achernar.dk</code> &ndash; was already registered in the winter of 2021, at that time being used for hosting on-line source code repositories. This was, however, quickly outsourced to <code><a href="https://mandelbrot.dk">mandelbrot.dk</a></code> after I had managed to secure that domain.</p>
				<br>
				<p><code>achernar.dk</code> was then, in the mean time, used for hosting a few look-up references. This mostly served as my own notes for school &ndash; mainly mathematics, physics, and chemistry &ndash; but quickly grew unorganised and umaintained, although I did have plans to expand the lexicon.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The idea of a company had started in the spring of 2020. At that time it would've been named after the binary system <em>Sheliak</em> (Bayer: <code>&beta; Lyr&#230;</code>). But it was this idea that evolved into <em>Achernar</em>.</p>
